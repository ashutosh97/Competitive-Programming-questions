The Curiosity robot is on Mars and is exploring its environment. It gathers evidence
soil and analyzes them in the hope of finding organic DNA sequences. From time to time
when it happens that the robot discovers such a sequence, it cannot give
the news continues until it is not certain that it is truly alien.
That is why he should check if not sequentially, the research can be formed from
sequence, they DNA with which it was contaminated on earth.
Because after the launch, the people discovered the contamination, they transmitted it to you
to the robot informed of all the DNA sequences in question.
You are required to create a program that checks for a given DNA sequence
if this can be formed by sequentially interlocking, the DNA taken from it
earth.
Obs.1: The spacing process is successful if all have been used
the characters in the input DNA (all sequences will be used, they are given).
Obs.2: The relative order of the characters in a component DNA is the same
in the resulting DNA.

Input data
The data will be read from the file, the file adn.in.
On the first line you will find the T number of tests in the file.
On the following T lines there is a test.
A test consists of an entire N, N, and character strings representing those
In sequence, it is the DNA and at the end the target string representing the DNA that is
wants tested.

The output will be written in the file, the adn.out file.
It will count, it holds T lines.
On each line, 0 will be written if the DNA tested cannot be formed from the other Ns
(so it is extraterrestrial DNA) or 1 otherwise.
