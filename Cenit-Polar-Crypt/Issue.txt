Create a solution that can be able to encrypt a string using Cenit-Polar Method

- Solution
Cenit Polar it's a basic scout crytographic method based on replace characters
corresponding this order :
-------------------------
| C | E  | N  | I  | T  | 
-------------------------
| P | O  | L  | A  | R  | 
-------------------------

The main idea is take a word and replace the characters which match in CENIT, with its equivalent on POLAR and viceversa.

For example, if you want to encrypt the word COMPUTER, you should have to replace any character.
If some character don't have match, you should keep it in place:

C = P
O = E
M = M
P = C
U = U
T = R
E = O
R = T

If you want to decript the word generated, you have to do reverse the process, replacing any character which have match in POLAR,
with its equivalent on CENIT :

P = C 
E = O 
M = M 
C = P 
U = U 
R = T 
O = E 
T = R 

Cenit - Polar makes this alphabet table:
A	B	C	D	E	F	G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	Ñ	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z
I	B	P	D	O	F	G	H	A	J	K	N	M	L	Ñ	E	C	Q	T	S	R	U	V	W	X	Y	Z
