Gigel is in a strange country, where each stadium is much longer
than width, imea, so that we can consider width, imea 1.
He read on the internet that the maximum length of a stadium in this country is longer
less than or equal to 2 âˆ— 10 9.
At each stadium there are a number of sprinklers used to water the lawn
before the matches.
The spray number i is placed at the coordinate xi and has the power pi. A
sprinklers can water a fixed segment of grass: more precisely if watering to the left will
cover the segment [x i - p i, x i], and if wet to the right it will cover the segment
[x i, x i + p i].
Gigel knows that the sprinklers are hidden in the lawn, buried in the ground. to
When placing an order, a sprinkler can come out on top and wet it either
left or right (depending on the order received).
If two sprinklers water at the same point, then one of them is considered
redundant and will be locked upright. We consider that in this position, ie
blocking, splashing i can only wet the segment [x i, x i] (because the power is reduced to
0).
This is a compromise solution, and the company that deals with
stadium management can do it for free. For any other operation, yes, se
charge a fee too high to be paid by the owner (he prefers to buy a
player than to put money in sprinklers again).
Because the owner of the stadium
he's probably upset because he doesn't
can use all sprinklers simultaneously
at full capacity (wet to the left or
to the right), he wonders who he is
maximum number of sprinklers used with
maximum power.
Gigel wishes to cheer you on
the employer and asks for help
determine
the maximum number of
sprinklers from the stadium watering
maximum power (not locked vertically).
For the right answer he gives you respect
and maximum score.

Input data
ALL the input data will be read from the file, the splash file. It has the following
formed:
- on the first line of the file of the sprinkler, the name of the stadium was found.
- on the second line are n and S, where n is the number of sprinklers in the stadium,
and S is the length of the stadium (harbor, grass juniors).
- on the third line are in numbers, the third number representing the coordinate x i
for the sprayer with the number i (x i expresses the distance away from the left edge of
lawn). This account holds separate and distinct elements.
- on the fourth line are in numbers, the third element representing the power i
for the sprayer i.

In the file, the stropitori.out yesterday will be written on the first line ONLY the maximum number
sprinklers from the stadium that water at maximum power.
