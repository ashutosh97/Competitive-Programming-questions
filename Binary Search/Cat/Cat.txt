N cats stay in line. N is always even because we want to pair the cats which have the same height in
the consecutive position(Each value of height can have only 1 pair). But the cats stay in a random position.
It is your task to find the size of the pocket to bring the cats and move it to the right position.

For Example:
N = 6 (6 cats)
Cat height = 3 3 2 5 5 2
We can see that the cats that height equals to 3 and 5 already each with the couple but the cats that
height equals to 2 didn't sit near to each other.
So, we will use the pocket that has the size of 2 to bring the two-unit-height cat to sit next to each other.
It'll become 3 3 2 2 5 5 or 3 3 5 5 2 2.

Input:
1st line contains amount of N while 1<=N<=2x10^6 or 2000000
Next N lines is hi stands for the height of cat number i while 1<=i<=N and 1<=hi<=2^31
Output:
The smallest size of pocket that can rearrange all cat to the right position.

3
Example output2:
3
(Use pocket size 3 to bring 2 and 3 cats sit next to each other it'll become 5 5 3 3 2 2 for example)

Example input3:
