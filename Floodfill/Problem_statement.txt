For those who don’t like regular images, ASCII Maps Inc. has created maps that are fully printable ASCII characters. Each map is a rectangular grid of lowercase English letters, where each letter stands for various locations. In particular, ‘w’ stands for water and the other 25 letters represent various different land locations. For this problem, we are interested in counting the number of bodies of water on a given ASCII map. A body of water is a maximal set of contiguous grid squares on the ASCII map where each square in the body of water shares a boundary with at least one other square in the body of water. Thus, for two grid squares to be part of the same body of water, one must be above, below, to the left, or to the right of the other grid square.
Input
The first line of input consists of two space separated integers, r (1=r=50) and c (1=c=50), the number of rows and columns, respectively for the input map. The next r lines will each contain c lowercase English letters, representing the corresponding row of the input map.

Output
On a line by itself, output the number of bodies of water in the input map.
