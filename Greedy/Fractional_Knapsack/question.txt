FRACTIONAL KNAPSACK

Problem Statement :
	Given weights and values of n items, we need to put these items in a knapsack of capacity W 
	to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.

	In the 0-1 Knapsack problem, we are not allowed to break items. We either take the whole item or donâ€™t take it. 
	But in Fractional Knapsack, we can break items for maximizing the total value of knapsack whic means we are 
	allowed to tahe a fraction of the item.

Example :
	Input:
	Items as (value, weight) pairs
	arr[] = {{60, 10}, {100, 20}, {120, 30}}
	Knapsack Capacity, W = 50;

	Output:
	Maximum possible value = 240
	by taking items of weight 10 and 20 kg and 2/3 fraction
	of 30 kg. Hence total price will be 60+100+(2/3)(120) = 240
