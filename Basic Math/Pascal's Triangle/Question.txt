Given a positive integer N, return the N rows of pascal's triangle.

Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients formed by summing up the elements of previous row.


Input :
 
 First line of the input file contains a single integer 't' that indicates the total number of test cases.
 Each of the next t lines contain the integer 'n' i.e. the row number.

 output :

 For each line of input output the Pascal's triangle till that row number.

 Example :

 Input:
 N = 4
 Output: 1
         1 1
         1 2 1
         1 3 3 1

 N = 5
 Output: 1
         1 1
         1 2 1
         1 3 3 1
         1 4 6 4 1
