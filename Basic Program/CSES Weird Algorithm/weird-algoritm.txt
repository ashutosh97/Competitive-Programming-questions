###Problem statement:

Consider an algorithm that takes as input a positive integer n. If n is even, the algorithm divides it by two, and if n is odd, the algorithm multiplies it by three and adds one. The algorithm repeats this, until n is one. For example, the sequence for n=3 is as follows:
3→10→5→16→8→4→2→1
Your task is to simulate the execution of the algorithm for a given value of n.

###Input:

The only input line contains an integer n.

###Output:

Print a line that contains all values of n during the algorithm.

###Constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6

###Example

Input:
3

Output:
3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
