I have made an insertion sort algorithm in c++.
This program uses a class as its data structure instead of array.
Input:-
first line will be the number of elements to be sorted
second line will contain n space separated elements
Output:-
The program will use insertion sort algorithm to output n space separated numbers in sorted order.
