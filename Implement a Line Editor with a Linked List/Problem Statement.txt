Implement a line editor with a linked list.  Include your code that implements a linked list.  Include your code for the line editor.  
Edit the main method to invoke your line editor implementation.  

-insertEnd:
insert at the end of the linked list

-print
prints the contents of the linked list with correct numbering

-search [string]
searches the linked list for the inputted string and print out the index and content of it. Otherwise, print "not found".

-edit [index]
edits the content of the linked list at the given index value

-delete [index]
deletes the node of the linked list at the given index value

-quit
quits the program

Hint: Use std::cin statements to read in the test cases with a while loop. Create your own node and linked list structure. Make sure 
your code works for linked lists of size > 9 (i.e. edit 10). Make sure simply calling the methods won't result in a crash.
